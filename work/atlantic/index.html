			<p>Atlantic Energias Renováveis is a holding company that develops, owns and operates renewable energy projects in Brazil. I was tasked to redesign their existing website, using flexible elements to improve their digital presence. The solution was to create a simple, sleek and intuitive website.</p>

			<h3>Role</h3>
			
			<p>During the project, my responsibilities included organizing meetings with the team that included Photographers, Content Strategists and Developers and also designing the information architecture (sitemaps and user flows), wireframing and the UI Design.  </p>

			<h3>Highlights</h3>

			<p>Indeed, this is one of the important projects I’ve worked on. The main design challenge was to use a video on the homepage, showing some shots from some company's wind farms. We chose to use a shot video, making some improvements with the front-end team. </p>

			<p>Another decision was to build a simple navigation that will expand in the future. Additionally, we rethought the navigation in the mobile, using some best practices to tap in links, menus and using a good typography size. </p>
