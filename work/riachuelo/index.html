            <p>Riachuelo is one of the most well-known department stores in Brazil. However, the company hadn't a mobile app that reflected its relevance and influence. </p>

			<p>At the GFT, Rafael Fioretti (executive business) and I was tasked to run a discovery project to help the company develop the foundation its new channel.</p>
			
			<p>The main challenge was to identify, outline, and generate ideas for a new e-commerce mobile app and, at the same time, improving a good experience for its customers.</p>

        <div class="six columns">
            <p>To accomplish that, we wanted to answer the question: <i>How might we convert the new app in the cornerstone of the Riachuelo's omnichannel strategy?</i></p>
            
            <p>After the meetings with stakeholders, we chose to use a desk research. It was divided into three main parts: 1 ) Competitive analysis of the main competitors 2) A deep heuristics analysis of its e-commerce (navigation structure, style guide, goods e voice tone) and 3) Good references and best practices in the e-mobile apps.</p>

        <div class="six columns">
            
            <p>We decided to run a co-creation workshop with partners, customers, and stakeholders based on Design thinking methodology. The main focus was to list opportunities and knowledge about the customer's behavior in the physical stores and also knowing their actual pain points.</p>
            
            <p>Following that, we had the opportunity to perform a brainstorming session using the <i>"How might we.."</i> technique. The questions were previously chosen by us to give some directions. Here some examples:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><i>How might we please the customers in the returns?</i></li>
                <li><i>How might we please the customers in the returns?</i></li>
                <li><i>How might we please the customers at the moment of choosing a good?</i></li>
                <li><i>How might we fascinate the customers in the dressing room?</i></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The sessions' results were incredible and confirmed our hypothesis about the main resources the app needed.</p>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>Once we understand the main opportunities and pain points during the customer's journey, we discover some "blindspots operations" the gone beyond the app. In an official presentation, we drove the issues for the stakeholders about the risks as part of our work.</p>
            
            <p>We organized all the main ideas in a MoSCoW (<i>Must have, Should have, Could have and Would have</i>)  matrix that helped us to visualize which functions the customers could interact with. This arrangement also was the foundation to prioritize what screens needed to be delivered.</p>

            <p>All the customer journey was produced and addressed to the Riachuelo's team.</p>

            <p>Sadly, I didn't cooperate in the project delivery stage. However, in 2019, the Riachuelo website and other digital channels received investments of R$ 168 million. The new app was launched respecting all the main elements, components, and layout decisions produced by us.</p>
