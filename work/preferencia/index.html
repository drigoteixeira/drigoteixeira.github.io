			<p>A2 Comunicação worked with Nova S/B to create a campaign about the importance of the crosswalk in the city of São Paulo. The project was called Preferência à Vida and introduced the “Crosswalk Man”.</p>

			<h3>Role</h3>

			<p>During the project with the team, my responsibilities included information architecture (sitemaps), wireframing and UI Design and a small front-end style guide. </p>

			<h3>Highlights and results</h3>
			
			<p>After the end of the campaign, I helped create a media showcase with the main KPI’s from social media and blog traffic access. Soon, the team decided to build a landing page that brought the main numbers and results from the digital campaign and also an image gallery with all photos taken from the Crosswalk Man. The result was so great that the landing page was transformed in a DVD. </p>
