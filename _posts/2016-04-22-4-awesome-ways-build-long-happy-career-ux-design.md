[Phil Clevenger](https://twitter.com/philclevenger), Director of Experience Design at Adobe, give us 4 simple principles to build a great, long and happy career in UX Design. Here it is: 

1. **Be Nice:** For one, nobody likes to work with a jerk. Moreover, positivity makes it safe for others to take risks around you. Today’s adversary may be tomorrow’s partner; it’s always better if they smile when they see you coming.
2. **Be engaged:** Our job is largely to help others realize something they imagine but cannot articulate. What a privilege, and how satisfying to help the blind men see the whole of the elephant for the first time!
3. **Be Large:** Generosity is powerful: make others shine, and when you shine, illuminate others. Bring them along on your thrill-ride; it’s fun and costs you nothing! And mentor as much as you can. You’ll be surprised how much you have to offer, and how much you get in return.
4. **Be human:** Eat smartly, exercise, play and sleep. When away from work, be away from work. Use that time to do other things you love, and to learn new things as well: blow glass, make sourdough bread, write a musical, wrestle jackalopes, build clock escapements, anything not work related.
