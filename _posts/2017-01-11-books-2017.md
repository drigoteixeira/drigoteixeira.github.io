Every year, I have a personal resolution for reading many books. In 2015, I read almost [20 books](/blog/livros-2015/) and in 2016, [I read just 11](/blog/livros-2016/) (but it is still a good mark). 

For 2017, I'm following the [Goodreads Reading Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/) with a goal of 10 books. The list bellow will show the all books I'll read in this year. 

If you have a book recommendation (new releases, biographies, historical, technical and so forth), feel free to share it in the comment box. =)
