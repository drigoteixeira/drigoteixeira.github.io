Here some short notes from the book '[Think Straight: Change your Thoughts, Change Your Life](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B077NJWFR3/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_GYVE1M9SVWK2CH0BRP6W)' by [Darius Foroux](https://dariusforoux.com/) which I would like to share with you: 

* Thoughts should serve a useful purpose. If they don't, they're useless. That's straight thinking.
* Remember: The quality of our thoughts determines the quality of our lives. And our decisions are a result of out thoughts.
* Every person creates their own social reality. The way you view the world os completely subjective because we all have cognitive bias. 
* If you have negative thoughts, you also have a negative perception of life. That's what is says. Our mind might be illogical, but it's also simple at the same time.
* The are no facts, only interpretations. 
* If you want to grow - financially, spiritually, mentally - you must revisit the details all the time.
