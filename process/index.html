				<h1>My Design Process.</h1>

				<h2>1. Discover</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Your goals: what you want to achieve with your product</li>
					<li>Your users’ goals: what your users want to achieve with the product</li>
					<li>Users: Who your users are and how they’d use the product; their age, occupation, personality, characteristics, behavior patterns, etc.</li>
					<li>Features you want to implement and how they are relevant to the goals</li>
					<li>Your competitors and how your product is different from theirs</li>
					<li>Constraints: Technology, deadline, etc.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>2. Define</h2>

				<p>With the insights I gather in the previous phase I’ll assess how best the features/functionality you’re planning to implement would add to the user experience of the product and help achieve our goals and our users’ goals. I’ll propose my ideas and concerns, if any. After discussion, together we’ll freeze the goals and the features for the project.</p>

				<p>Next we’ll define the priorities of user tasks (for apps) and content (for websites):</p>

				<p>For apps, I’ll create a use case diagram, a spreadsheet that lists the tasks and the paths a user can take to complete the tasks. We’ll prioritize the use cases into high, medium and low. The goal is to structure the app in such a way that a user can complete the highest priority tasks in minimum number of steps.</p>

				<p>For websites I’ll create a rough site map that gives a bird’s eye view of the organization of content.</p>

				<h2>3. Design the works</h2>

				<p>In this phase we’ll nail down the best way to organize information across the screens, within the screen, how to navigate between screens and how the product would respond to user actions.</p>

				<p>I’ll begin by sketching the pages. I’ll explore a lot of possible ideas for layout, navigation and interaction. Then I’ll go through them with a critical eye to weigh them against our requirement, platform-specific design guidelines, established design patterns, basic design principles and our constraints to decide on the best.</p>

				<p>Then I’ll create wireframes and send them to you. The wireframes will also contain notes on interaction and any other minutiae that should reach you and the developers. Usually I don’t communicate via sketches but if you’re hard-pressed for time I may send the sketches instead of wireframes.</p>

				<h2>4. Design the looks</h2>

				<p>Once we’re satisfied with the way the product would work, we’ll have to establish a visual style that is appropriate for the app and its users, and also agreeable to you. To get a feel for your preferred visual style I’d ask you to send me samples of designs that you like. Then I’ll flesh out the visuals of one or more key pages/screens using appropriate colors, typography, and icons. Once we agree on a visual style I’ll design the remaining screens in the same visual style.</p>

				<h2>5. Design the looks</h2>

				<p>Once we’re happy with the design I’ll publish you the final deliverables and communicate the design decisions in such a way that your development team can understand and implement. The final deliverables usually are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Screen mockups in PDF, PNG and PSD formats.</li>
					<li>Images assets such as the icons in all the required resolutions in SVG/PNG format.</li>
					<li>Style guide that specifies colors and typography and some important, recurring dimensions such as the width of UI elements, spacing between them, etc.</li>
					<li>Detailed specifications of each screen (optional).</li>
				</ul>
