			<h3 class="subheader">Define</h3>

			<p>Insights (from the previous phase), definition about the users'goals. We'll build an use case diagram (for apps), site map and content inventory (for websites). </p>

		<div class="four columns">
			<i class="icon-note icons"></i>
			<h3 class="subheader">Prototype</h3>
		
			<p>We’ll decide the best way to organize information across the screens (sketching), how to navigate between screens and how the product would respond to user actions (wireframe and/or clickable prototype).</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">Design</h3>

			<p>I’ll flesh out the visuals of one or more key pages/screens using appropriate colors, typography, and icons. Once we agree on a visual style I’ll design the remaining screens in the same visual style.</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">Delivery</h3>
			
			<p>I’ll share the final deliverables in such a way that the development team can understand and implement. The final deliverables usually are: PNG, PDF and PSD formats and also a Style guide. </p>

		<div class="four columns">
			<i class="icon-loop icons"></i>
			<h3 class="subheader">Iterate</h3>
			
			<p>Once the development team has built the product I’ll do a test run and check if the design has come up as we envisioned. I’ll write down the discrepancies and send it to the team for revision.</p>
