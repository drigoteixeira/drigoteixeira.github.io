			<h2>Hello! =)</h2>

			<p><b>Hey you!</b> I have over 8 years experience in designing interfaces for the web. I work with businesses, individuals and agencies across South America to help them create high quality and effective digital projects. I believe in using design to solve problems with simple and effective solutions.</p>

			<p>Although I consider myself a designer foremost, I have an extensive background in prototyping/development including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Iâ€™m always interested in hearing about cool new projects so <a href="mailto:drigoteixeira@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!</p>
