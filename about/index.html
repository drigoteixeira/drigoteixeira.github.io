			<p>I’m a digital designer based in São Paulo, Brazil. Currently working at <a href="http://www.a2ad.com.br">A2ad</a> as Lead Designer. </p>

			<p>I have over ten years of hands-on experience in designing digital products and services, ensuring high-quality and exercising diplomatic client and team management skills. </p>

I’m always interested in hearing about cool new projects so <a href="mailto:drigoteixeira@gmail.com">get in touch</a> or <a href="/blog/">visit my blog</a> (in Portuguese).</p>

				<dl> 
					<dt>1. Discovery</dt>

					<dd>I’ll try out your existing product, if you have one, to get a better understanding of the product. I’ll try out your competitors’ products to see where we stand compared to them and how they’ve solved some of our common problems. This is to understand who and what we’re against and use it to position and improve our product.</dd>

					<dd>I’ll go through any information that can help me understand the users, their requirement and their behavior such as, survey results, customer feedback, app/site analytics reports, user testing videos, etc.</dd>

					<dt>2. Defining</dt>

					<dd>With the insights I gather in the previous phase I’ll assess how best the features/functionality you’re planning to implement would add to the user experience of the product and help achieve our goals and our users’ goals. I’ll propose my ideas and concerns, if any. After discussion, together we’ll freeze the goals and the features for the project.</dd>

					<dd>Next we’ll define the priorities of user tasks (for apps) and content (for websites):</dd>

					<dd>For apps, I’ll create a use case diagram, a spreadsheet that lists the tasks and the paths a user can take to complete the tasks. We’ll prioritize the use cases into high, medium and low. The goal is to structure the app in such a way that a user can complete the highest priority tasks in minimum number of steps.</dd>

					<dd>For websites I’ll create a rough site map that gives a bird’s eye view of the organization of content.</dd>

					<dt>3. Designing the works</dt>

					<dd>In this phase we’ll nail down the best way to organize information across the screens, within the screen, how to navigate between screens and how the product would respond to user actions.</dd>

					<dd>I’ll begin by sketching the pages. I’ll explore a lot of possible ideas for layout, navigation and interaction. Then I’ll go through them with a critical eye to weigh them against our requirement, platform-specific design guidelines, established design patterns, basic design principles and our constraints to decide on the best.</dd>

					<dd>Then I’ll create wireframes and send them to you. The wireframes will also contain notes on interaction and any other minutiae that should reach you and the developers. Usually I don’t communicate via sketches but if you’re hard-pressed for time I may send the sketches instead of wireframes.</dd>

					<dd>If the app is simple I’ll create a wireflow that shows the navigation between screens—where a link leads to, what happens when you click a button, etc.</dd>

					<dd>If the app is complex it might be difficult to understand the flow using the wireframes alone. So, I’ll create a clickable prototype using the wireframes so that we can be sure that the app works the way we want. If you have access to users you can also show the prototypes to users and test the design.</dd>

					<dt>4. Designing the looks</dt>

					<dd>Once we’re satisfied with the way the product would work, we’ll have to establish a visual style that is appropriate for the app and its users, and also agreeable to you. To get a feel for your preferred visual style I’d ask you to send me samples of designs that you like. Then I’ll flesh out the visuals of one or more key pages/screens using appropriate colors, typography, and icons. Once we agree on a visual style I’ll design the remaining screens in the same visual style.</dd>

					<dt>5. Delivering and iterating</dt>

					<dd>Once you’re happy with the design I’ll send you the final deliverables and communicate the design decisions in such a way that your development team can understand and implement. The final deliverables usually are:</dd>
