			<p>The Secretaria de Educação de São Paulo was one of the most important public institutions in Brazil. The project started in 2011 and for all these years, we have helped them to improve their portal, showing the best services, information and projects to society. </p>

			<h3>Role</h3>

			<p>During the project, my responsibilities included organizing meetings with the Content Strategists, Design and Development team and also, designing the information architecture (sitemaps and user flows), wireframing and the UI Design. </p>

			<p>I helped to build the style guide which made it possible to build more than 70 landing pages to special projects and initiatives. For the portal, we built an information architecture to improve their homepage.</p>

			<h3>Highlights</h3>
			
			<p>The colors, style and typography were inspired by the arts that are shared in social media (Facebook and Twitter), always prioritizing the playful, live and fun colors. We also brought the videos to the homepage to connect and improve the engagement in YouTube, showing the diversity of the content to the user. </p>

			<p>After the redesign, the traffic access in the homepage grew 45%. </p>
