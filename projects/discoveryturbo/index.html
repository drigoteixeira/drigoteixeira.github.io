			<p>Discovery Turbo was launched on the Brazillian PayTV in 2014. We at A2ad were tasked to design a hot site to present the new channel and also to give the brand a modern and friendly feel to show the love to motors and velocity.</p>

			<h2>Role</h2>

			<p>During the project, my responsibilities included organizing meetings with the Content Strategists, Design and Development team and also, designing the information architecture (sitemaps), wireframing and the UI Design.</p>

			<h2>Highlights</h2>

			<p>The hotsite needed to be hosted in a different place and connected by an iframe with the Discovery servers, which required serious efforts to build a friendly SEO and also a good responsive website.  </p>
			
			<p>As part of the project, we chose to build the hotsite entirely in WordPress that gives content editors the ability to add/edit all of the content on the site easily and gives us control to make adjustments on the responsive version. </p>

			<p>Even temporary, the project had a great acceptance by the public. The hotsite had 12% of engagement and 31 million of people were impacted. </p>
