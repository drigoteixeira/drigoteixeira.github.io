            <p class="subtitle">A new fresh design for a new company</p>
            
             <p>Atlantic Energias Renov√°veis is a holding company that owns, develops, and operates renewable energy projects.</p>

			<p>When I was at A2ad, I was tasked to redesign their existing website, using flexible elements to improve their digital presence. The main goal was to create a simple and sleek website to represent their position in the market.</p>

            <h2>The website redesign</h2>
            <p>The main challenge was to use a video on the homepage, highlighting some shots from the Atlantic's wind farms. We chose to use a short video, making some performance improvements with the front-end team.</p>
            
            <p>Another decision was to build simple navigation that will expand in the future. Additionally, we rethought the navigation in the mobile, using some best practices to improve the "tap" in links, buttons, and links. </p>
