            <p>Consa is one of the most prestigious Catholic schools in São Paulo and makes part of the ACF (Associação Cultura Franciscana) educational system.</p>
            
            <p>Established in the neighborhood Moema, ACF demanded a new institutional website that could expose their history, structure, and the pedagogical program. The main goal was to invite the parents to visit the school and improve the number of students admissions.</p>

            <h2>Findings</h2>

            <p>During the project, my responsibilities included organizing meetings with the Design and Development team and also, composing the information architecture (sitemaps and user flows), wireframing, and UI Design.</p>

			<p>Additionally, I did a desk research to know more about the competitors and about how to make good design approach to a school project.</p>

			<p>We also built a style guide that helped to build more six websites similar to Consa.</p>

            <h2>Learnings</h2>

            <p>I enjoyed working on this project because the principal approach was to use the student's photos to give the meaning and of the school's image. </p>
            
            <p>Moreover, the client was cooperative and organized and they served a lot to build a consistent digital project.</p>
            

			<p>In some meetings together, the main challenge was to show some design to the Sisters who are members of the board's school. The feedback was exceptional. </p>
