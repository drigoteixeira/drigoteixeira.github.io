			<p>Consa is one of the most important Catholic schools in São Paulo and makes part of the ACF (Associação Cultura Franciscana) educational system. Located in the neighborhood Moema, they needed a new institutional website that highlighted their history, structure and the pedagogical proposal. The main goal was to invite the parents to visit the school and improve the number of enrollments. </p>

			<h2>Role</h2>

			<p>During the project, my responsibilities included organizing meetings with the Design and Development team and also, designing the information architecture (sitemaps and user flows), wireframing and the UI Design. </p>

			<p>Additionally, I did some desk research to know more about the competitors and some research about how to make a good navigation to a school project. </p>

			<p>We also built a style guide that helped to build mother six websites similar to Consa. </p>

			<h2>Highlights and results</h2>

			<p>I loved to work in this project because the main approach was to use the student's photos to show the importance and the grandiosity of the school. Moreover, the client was very friendly and organized and they helped a lot to build a consistent digital project. </p>

			<p>In some meetings together, the main challenge was to show some design to the Sisters who are members of the board of the school. The feedback was great.  </p>

			<p>As a result of the design and content strategies, the website was responsible for improvisa the enrollments in 35%. </p>
